    "\n",
    "As an avid beach volleyball player, I place high value on my group always having access to a beach court. Thus I bought us a Park&Sun portable net system to ensure that we always had access to a net.  However, what I did not realize was that despite the P&S website advertising strongly suggesting that their products are beach nets, their nets are, in fact,   grass systems.  The adapter on the base of their volleyball net poles only work on grass, not on sand (as I discovered first hand).  Park&Sun *does* sell a sand adapter kit with special pole base plates for a hefty $60.  However, having access to a 3D printer, I set about making my own modification kit.  This blog will describe the design process I followed while making my kit.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes before we begin: I don't have many pictures of the net setup.  This is because in addition to being my volleyball group's head engineer, I am also our organizer.  So while I would like to take time to take pictures of various systems I build, I am often preoccupied with starting our sessions, answering questions about technique or strategy, and otherwise ensuring that our sessions run smoothly.  As a result, here I lean *heavily* on CAD renders for images of design iterations.  Also, this project was designed in FreeCAD.  While I know SolidWorks, it is an expensive application. Since I obviously completed this on my own time at home, using a free option like FreeCAD was the way to go.    \n",

    "* Cost (as low as possible, ideally <$20 for a set of 2)\n",
    "* Compressive strength (needs to take stresses up to ~2300psi)\n",

This requirement also offers guidance on what material to work with.  Since I'm planning on printing a plastic part, I'm thinking of starting with a cheaper material.  \n",

Hence, my initial designs attempted to bypass the odd geometry of the plug and use a solution that just fit around it.  Later on, after noticing that the plug positions had obviously shifted, I made a more earnest and ultimately successful attempt to remove them.  This opened the door to a more convenient (and resilient) plug design.  The plug sits more snugly in the pole and sand can't easily pile up between the base of the pole and the top of the adapter plate.   "

This way, there would be some resistance if the pole tried to shift laterally in the sand.  This initial design wasn't practical, since it would be very difficult to print on a 3D printer.  Generally speaking, printers cannot print large overhangs (faces that extend horizontally out from the part).  You can add support material to hold up the print as it prints, but that adds cost and generates waste.  I wanted a design that would not need supports.  Thus the fin design was out.  \n",

    "This is because I found myself under a time crunch after Revision 3.  I needed a working adapter in two days, and after printing the PLA prototypes with the wrong plug diameter, I knew that I could not print a corrected version in time.  I tried sanding down the diameter to no avail.  In desperation, I played around with the print settings and looked at removing the fins and just printing the plate and plug portions of the part.  It may slip, but at least we would be able to try and play volleyball.  I printed the PETG versions, stuck them on my net...and found that they worked perfectly.  This was the first time I was able to fully set up the net with the plates correctly attached.  I found that, when set up, the net generates a *lot* more force than I can when pressing down on the plate, and the resulting normal force generates enough friction to resist shifting in the sand.  It will still shift a little, maybe a couple of centimeters throughout the day, but I'm generally making adjustments to the net throughout the day anyway as people and volleyballs collide with the net.  Thus, by pure chance, Revision 4 came to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another finding from this live test was that the part was always buried under sand, whether by chance during the setup process or by the wind throughout the day.  This addressed the temperature and UV exposure requirements, since the sand is *considerably* cooler an inch or two beneath the surface and UV light does not penetrate that deep.    \n",

It stood to reason that increasing the area of the plate would fix this problem.  Thus, I increased the diameter to the maximum I could print, stuck it on my net, and found that the net sunk less as a result.  And now, two years later, the original parts are still holding up.    \n",

    "\n",
    "When designing this adapter, my material options were PLA and PETG.  For those unfamiliar with 3D printing, PLA is the go-to printing material.  It is exceptionally easy to print with.  And even though it is one of the weakest printing materials, doesn't yield printed parts with good dimensional accuracy, and has poor temperature and UV resistance, most prints are aesthetic in nature and don't require robust mechanical performance.  Also, at the time I was designing this, PLA cost about 20% less per kilo than PETG, my other option.  PETG's higher cost is not without reason, however.  In contrast with PLA, PETG is far stronger, more temperature resistant, more UV resistant, and has excellent dimensional accuracy.  For any mechanical parts I design, PETG is my metarial of choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both now and when I was designing these parts, some hard numbers for the compressive strength of PLA and PETG would have been useful.  Unfortunately, this information is hard to come by.  Manufacturers don't list it on  their websites, and independent measurements are hard to come by.  Part of the problem is that the mechanical properties of printed parts are dependent on much more than the material.  *How* you print also matters (what speed, what % infill, etc.) as well as water content of the filament, the color of the filament (different additives mean that different colors of PLA have wildly different mechanical properties), and the manufacturer (e.g. all else being the same, the same color PLA from three different manufacturers will have different mechanical properties).  While I could measure these properties myself, building the kind of setup to do it is expensive and time-consuming.  Time and budget permitting, I would like to look into it at some point and get some hard numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, though, trial, error, and experience drove my decisions. And after trial and error, PLA ended up being too weak.  Prototype parts in the first few design iterations were crushed when subjected to even a small load.  On the other hand, PETG performed phenomenally.  At 50% infill and four perimters, it withstood the compressive forces involved in setting up the net without any problem.  To this day, after hundreds of loading cycles with varying amounts of force used to tighten the guy lines, the original PETG parts are holding up.  While PETG is clearly the better mechancial material, using it for prototype parts to check dimensions or see how a final print will look is not cost effective.  It generally makes sense to print a cheaper PLA prototype with less material to save on cost.  So, each material has its function in mechancial build.            \n",

In fact, more than infill or print speed, the number of perimeters is the primary factor in determining a part's strength. Again, not having any hard numbers, quantifying how much stronger a part is with extra perimeters is difficult.  But, given that the part still holds up now, I'd rather have too many perimeters than too few.

Two ideas I had were to reduce the height of the plug portion of the base plate to reduce the amount of space sand can occupy.  The plug doesn't need to be as tall as it is anyway.  In addition to this, I thought about adding some flexible tabs.  So even if sand does get in the system, the flexible tabs should give me some leeway to work the plug out.  My second idea was to add a center hole to the base plate.  I might drop a rope through this hole to offer better leverage, but regardless of that having access to the center axis of the base plate would make removal far easier.  This obviously opens up the possibility of getting even *more* sand in the pole.  Yet it's just an idea at this point and would need to be tested.

    "I'm not sure if it comes out in my description, but I really enjoyed this project.  Using my mechanical knowledge to solve a volleyball problem and create something that actually *worked* and continues to work is incredible.  And the process of imagining a part, thinking it through, designing it, bringing it to life, and testing it is really rewarding.  I learned a lot from the successful decisions I made.  I also learned a lot from the unsuccessful ones as well.  I also emerged with inspiration for how I could improve the project even more or apply the lessons I learned to future projects.  That, perhaps, is an easily overlooked benefit of this kind of project:  the reward isn't just the thing you've made now, it's the things this experience will allow you to make in the future.   \n",
